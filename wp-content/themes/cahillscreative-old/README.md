# Sage-9-timber

Sage-9-timber is [Sage theme](https://github.com/roots/sage) version 9 made to work with [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/).

For easy integrations and later compatibility, this repository aimed at making the minimum of changes possible to the original Sage 9 beta 4 in order to make Timber work. This theme has still blade template language support.

**Sage 9 is in active development and is currently in beta. This initial fork used version Sage 9 beta 4. If you want a stable version of Sage ported to Timber, have a look at the [sage-timber](https://github.com/artifex404/sage-timber) project.**

## Features

* Sass for stylesheets
* ES6 for JavaScript
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compiling assets, optimizing images, and concatenating and minifying files
* [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for synchronized browser testing
* [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/blade) as a templating engine
* [Controller](https://github.com/soberwp/controller) for passing data to Blade templates
* CSS framework options:
  * [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * [Bulma](http://bulma.io/)
  * [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
  * [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)
  * None (blank slate)
