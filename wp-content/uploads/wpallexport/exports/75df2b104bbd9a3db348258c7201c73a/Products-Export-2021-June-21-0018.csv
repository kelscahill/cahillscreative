2052,"Large Sliding Bard Door Plans","Give your home the Farmhouse<img style=""border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;"" src=""//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cahillscreati-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1"" alt="""" width=""1"" height=""1"" border=""0"" /> with a sliding barn door. Not only are they ascetically pleasing, but are a great solution for small spaces. Since they slide against the wall, you don't have to worry about a door swinging open and being in the way. This was the problem that I had in my small home. As I would walk down the hallway I'd constantly be navigating through a maze of doors. That's when I realized that a barn door would resolve this problem and created plans for everyone to do the same. The PDF plans, which will be posted soon, include a material cut list, a list of necessary tools &amp; hardware, assembly directions, and dimensions.
